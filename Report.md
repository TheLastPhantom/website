students is based on mails. Due to this some important mails are quite often missed and students
gmail is often filled with lots of unwanted mails.

# Our Solution :
We developed a secure website for the IIT Dh community which is intuitive and easy
to use. Students can select the keyword, which decides which kind of emails he/she wants to
receieve. The website automates the task to remind them about the upcoming events by
sending an email to their registered email address and updating their google calander.
The event organiser updates the details of the event to be sent as a mail on the website.
He/she selects the keywords and details related to the event which is followed by updating 
the calendar on the website by the admin. Only admin has the authorisation to update the main calendar.
Students can easily keep track of all upcoming events using their calendar provided on the website,
while see the events that they are interested in using their own google calendar.

## Technical Details :
We used the following technologies to come up with our solution :
* HTML,JS,Bootstrap for frontend.
* PHP,Mysql for backend.
* Google Calendar API 
* OpenID for secure login.
